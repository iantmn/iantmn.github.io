## The Challenge

A FINTECH client asked us to migrate their refund logic from Google Cloud tasks to PubSub. All refunds are asynchronous and need to be processed in the background. The client wanted to leverage PubSub's scalability and reliability to handle the increasing number of refund requests efficiently.

## The Solution

We designed a solution that integrates PubSub into the client's existing infrastructure to manage refund requests. The refund logic was refactored to publish messages to PubSub topics, which are then consumed by subscribers to process the refunds. This asynchronous processing allows the client to handle refunds more efficiently without impacting the user experience.

## Challenges & Learnings

- 🧩 **Data Consistency**: Ensuring data consistency between the refund requests and the processing logic was crucial. We implemented a mechanism to handle retries and ensure that refunds are processed accurately.
- ❌ **Error Handling**: Handling errors during the refund process was a key consideration. We designed a robust error handling system to manage exceptions and ensure that refunds are processed successfully.
- 📈 **Monitoring & Logging**: Setting up monitoring and logging for the PubSub integration was essential for tracking refund requests and processing times. We implemented logging and monitoring solutions to provide visibility into the refund process.
- ⏩ **Scalability**: PubSub's scalability was a significant advantage for handling the increasing volume of refund requests. We optimized the PubSub configuration to ensure that the system can scale to meet the client's needs.
