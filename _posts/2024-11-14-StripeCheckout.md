## The Challenge

The client, a multi-tenant booking platform, wanted to integrate Stripe Checkout to enable secure and seamless payments for their users. They needed a solution that could handle multiple tenants, each with their own Stripe accounts, and provide a consistent payment experience across the platform. Previously, the client had used a custom payment solution that was not scalable and lacked the security features of Stripe Checkout.

## The Solution

We designed a solution that integrated Stripe Checkout into the client's platform to provide a secure and seamless payment experience for their users. The solution involved creating a multi-tenant architecture that allowed each tenant to connect their own Stripe account to the platform. We implemented a custom checkout flow that leveraged Stripe's APIs to handle payments securely and efficiently.

We also implemented a service fee that our client could charge to their users for using the platform. This service fee was calculated dynamically based on the tenant's pricing model and was deducted from the total payment amount before it was transferred to the tenant's Stripe account.

## Challenges & Learnings

- 👥 **Multi-tenant architecture:** Designing a multi-tenant architecture that could handle multiple Stripe accounts and service fee amounts was a complex task. We had to ensure that the payment flow was secure and efficient for all tenants.
- 🧪 **Testing and validation:** Testing the payment flow and service fee calculation was crucial to ensure that the solution worked as expected. We conducted extensive testing and validation to identify and fix any issues.
- 🔒 **Security and compliance:** Ensuring that the payment flow met Stripe's security and compliance requirements was essential. We implemented best practices to protect user data and prevent fraud.
