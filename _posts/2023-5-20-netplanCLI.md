Netplan is a tool for configuring networking on Linux. It is used by Ubuntu and other Linux distributions. It is a YAML network configuration abstraction for various backends. Netplan reads network configuration from /etc/netplan/*.yaml. During early boot it then generates backend specific configuration files in /run to hand off control of devices to a particular networking daemon. How this works is explained in the [Netplan.io documentation](https://netplan.io/). 

However, my client found it difficult to use the YAML syntax and wanted a CLI tool to configure the network. I created this tool in Python. It uses the Netplan.io CLI to generate the YAML file with a easier to use interface. The tool is also used to automate the installation of their products. It works on most network configurations, but it is not a complete replacement for the Netplan.io CLI. Because of the complexity of the Netplan.io CLI and the requirements of my client, I decided to create a new tool instead of extending the Netplan.io CLI.
