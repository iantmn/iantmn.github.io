## Automating ticket creation for seamless technical support
My client faced challenges with technical support calls, as manually retrieving customer information and creating tickets in their CRM system was time-consuming. To streamline this process, I developed a connector between their SIP server and Vtiger CRM, automating ticket creation and improving efficiency.

## The Solution
The connector, built in Python, bridges communication between the SIP server (via the SIP protocol) and Vtiger CRM (via its API). When a call comes in, the system automatically triggers a pop-up in Vtiger, displaying customer details. With a single click, a support ticket can be created, drastically reducing response time.

## Key Features

✅ Automated Call Handling – Extracts caller information from SIP messages and retrieves customer details from Vtiger's database.

📊 One-Click Ticket Creation – Generates a pop-up in Vtiger CRM, allowing support agents to create tickets instantly.

🔍 SIP Integration with Regex Processing – Uses regex to extract key details from SIP messages for accurate data retrieval.

🖥️ Softphone Functionality with pyVoIP – Leverages pyVoIP to receive SIP messages, process call data, and display real-time notifications.

🔔 Windows Toast Notifications – Provides instant pop-ups with customer information, linking directly to the relevant Vtiger CRM page.

## Challenges & Learnings
Integrating SIP with a CRM was a complex task due to the intricacies of the SIP protocol. Understanding how to extract meaningful data from SIP messages took significant effort. By using pyVoIP, regex parsing, and database queries, I successfully created a seamless and efficient automation solution.

This integration not only reduces workload for support agents but also improves response time and customer satisfaction by making ticket creation effortless.
