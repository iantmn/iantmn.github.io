description: "For my bachelor thesis I created a climate control system for a high-tech greenhouse. The goal of this project was to create a system that can control the climate in a greenhouse to grow plants in the most optimal conditions, improving the yield and quality of the plants as well as improving sustainability."

Kubo greenhouses challenged me for my bachelor thesis to make their own greenhouse design named the Ultra-Clima more sustainable and efficient. While researching I found out a couple of things:
- The climate control systems on the market are not optimal for the Ultra-Clima greenhouse, because they are designed for the standard Venlo greenhouse.
- The horticulturalists are not happy with the current climate control systems, because they are not user-friendly and lack a lot of features and automation.
- Horticulturalist need to train new horticulturalists which can take anywhere from 2 to 5 years, because indoor climate control is a complex subject and there are not a lot of tools to help them.
- Even experienced horticulturalists sometimes couldn't predict the climate in the greenhouse, because the climate is influenced by a lot of (sometimes unexpected) factors.

With this information I started to think about how I could fix these problems. As is customary in the field of Industrial Design Engineering, I created a frame, a design statement, I used co-creation sessions with the stakeholders, I created prototypes to test my ideas, I iterated on the prototypes and I created a final product. The final product is a climate control system that can control the climate in the Ultra-Clima greenhouse, but also in other greenhouses.

The system consists of these key parts:
- A climate control system that can control the climate in the greenhouse and read information from sensors, just like the current systems on the market, but it is optimised for the Ultra-Clima greenhouse (or any other greenhouse).
- With this data an AI model is trained to predict the climate in the greenhouse, so the horticulturalist can see what the climate will be in the future and can take action if necessary.
  - The AI model is also used to give advice to the horticulturalist about what actions they can take to improve the climate in the greenhouse
  - The AI model is also used to predict what a certain action will do to the climate in the greenhouse, so the horticulturalist can see what the effect of their actions will be.
  - The AI model can also take proactive actions to improve the climate in the greenhouse, like closing the window if it predicts rain or starting the heating of the greenhouse if it predicts a cold night.
- This system can also be used to train new horticulturalists, because the AI model can explain why it takes certain actions and what the effect of these actions will be. This way the horticulturalist can learn from the AI model and can take over the control of the greenhouse when they are ready.
  - In addition to that an experienced horticulturalist can use the AI model to predict the climate in the greenhouse, so they can focus on other tasks and only take over the control of the greenhouse when necessary as well as take over the control of multiple greenhouses at the same time.
