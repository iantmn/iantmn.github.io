## The Challenge
A door manufacturing company faced inefficiencies in their production process. With a growing number of orders, they needed a solution to optimize workflow and reduce errors. Their production process involved multiple steps, including cutting, painting, and assembling doors. Workers relied on insufficient instructions, which led to miscommunication and delays.

## The Solution
To address these challenges, we developed an intuitive iPad-based production management system. The software provides step-by-step guidance for each stage of production, ensuring workers follow the correct procedures.

### Key features
- 📋 Step-by-step instructions for each stage of production.
- 📊 Real-time tracking of progress.
- 🔔 Automated alerts for quality control and delays.
- 📱 Touch-friendly UI designed for factory environments.

By integrating this system, the company improved efficiency, reduced errors, and achieved better production flow.

## Challenges & Learnings
- ⚙️**Business logic:** Understanding the intricacies of the production process was crucial to designing an effective solution. This required close collaboration with the client and frequent feedback sessions.
- ✨**User experience:** Designing a user-friendly interface for factory workers was a unique challenge. We conducted on-site testing to ensure the software was intuitive and easy to use.

A unique challenge was the structural approach we took for this project. While we used Django for the backend, we implemented a single model, serializer, and view file for the entire project. Instead of cluttering the main codebase with complex logic, we encapsulated all business logic in separate service files, ensuring clean, maintainable, and modular code. This was a different approach than usual, but it worked out great.
