Hi, I'm Ian Tiemann, a Project Manager from the Netherlands with a background in Industrial Design Engineering from TU Delft and computer science in Breda. I‚Äôm passionate about all aspects of IT & software development, with a particular focus on **project management**, **backend development**, **networking** and **big projects**. I‚Äôm also interested in **machine learning & AI**.

## üè´ My education

My degree in Industrial Design Engineering has provided me with a broad skill set for designing products and services that are both desirable and practical for users and businesses. I‚Äôve studied how to research user needs, improve existing products, and prototype solutions. Working in multidisciplinary teams and effectively communicating with different stakeholders has also been a key part of my education. While this program isn‚Äôt focused on IT or project management, I gained valuable skills that have proven beneficial in my IT career. Like **problem-solving**, **creativity**, **communication**, and **collaboration**.

I‚Äôm a strong advocate for Design Thinking, a problem-solving approach centered on human needs, technology possibilities, and business requirements. It‚Äôs a mindset that fuels innovation and guides my approach to design, development and project management.

In addition, I completed a minor in **Engineering with Artificial Intelligence**, where I explored machine learning and data science. One notable project was developing a tool that analyzes how design concepts are used by end-users to help designers refine their ideas. You can read more about this project [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2023-2-13-MinorCapstoneAI.md %}).

I‚Äôve also worked on various projects with microcontrollers and software. I have experience with Python, C, and CircuitPython, and I‚Äôm eager to expand my knowledge and skills in other programming languages.

Courses like **Business model design**, **Leadership and Project Organisation** and **Entrepreneurial Innovation by Design** gave me a solid foundation in business and management principles, which I believe are essential for project managers. Next to that I also have a strong affinity with IT and software development, which I have been practicing for multiple years.

## ‚ú® My experience

I have multiple years of experience in IT, starting as an IT support engineer and eventually **managing projects and clients independently**. In 2022, I transitioned into software development during my minor, where I developed tools to connect software systems and automate tasks. This included creating a digital signage system for clients and a tool to help support engineers retrieve customer information from their CRM efficiently. Alongside this, I‚Äôve maintained networks, servers, and workstations, providing customer support where needed.

Next to the technical side of IT, I also have experience in project management. I‚Äôve managed multiple projects, including onboarding new companies, developing new software tools, and implementing new technologies. I‚Äôve worked with cross-functional teams, including developers, designers, stakeholders and suppliers, to ensure projects are delivered on time and within budget. I‚Äôve also worked with clients to identify their needs, develop project plans, and ensure successful project delivery.

While studying at TU Delft, I also worked as a student assistant, guiding students through Python programming and microcontroller projects, helping them with assignments and practical applications of their learning. Next to that I also gave lectures to students about programming in Python.

I believe that a strong project manager is one who can effectively communicate with stakeholders, manage resources, but also understand the technical aspects of the project. My background in Industrial Design Engineering and IT has given me a unique perspective that allows me to bridge the gap between IT, development, and project management.

## üö© What is my goal?

I‚Äôm eager to continue growing as a project manager and ultimately transition into a role as R&D Manager or IT Manager in the future. I want to develop my leadership skills, manage cross-functional teams, and contribute to the strategic planning and successful delivery of IT projects. Next to that I want to improve companies by implementing new technologies and methodologies, and by creating a culture of innovation and continuous improvement.
