Hi, I'm Ian Tiemann, a software engineer from the Netherlands with a background in Industrial Design Engineering from TU Delft and currently pursuing computer science studies in Breda. I‚Äôm passionate about all aspects of software development, with a particular focus on **project management**, **backend development** and the intersection of software and hardware, such as **embedded systems and IoT**. I‚Äôm also deeply interested in **machine learning**, especially in implementing machine learning models into software.

I also have multiple years of experience in IT. I started out als IT support engineer and eventually **managed projects and clients** on my own.

## üè´ My education

My degree in Industrial Design Engineering has provided me with a broad skill set for designing products and services that are both desirable and practical for users and businesses. I‚Äôve studied how to research user needs, improve existing products, and prototype solutions. Working in multidisciplinary teams and effectively communicating with different stakeholders has also been a key part of my education. While this program isn‚Äôt focused on software engineering, I gained valuable skills that have proven beneficial in my software development career.

I‚Äôm a strong advocate for Design Thinking, a problem-solving approach centered on human needs, technology possibilities, and business requirements. It‚Äôs a mindset that fuels innovation and guides my approach to both design and development.

In addition, I completed a minor in **Engineering with Artificial Intelligence**, where I explored machine learning and data science. One notable project was developing a tool that analyzes how design concepts are used by end-users to help designers refine their ideas. You can read more about this project [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2023-2-13-MinorCapstoneAI.md %}).

I‚Äôve also worked on various projects with microcontrollers, servers and networks. I have experience with Python, C, and CircuitPython, and I‚Äôm eager to expand my knowledge and skills in other programming languages and technologies.

## ‚ú® My experience

I have multiple years of experience in IT, starting as an IT support engineer and eventually **managing projects and clients independently**. In 2022, I transitioned into software development during my minor, where I developed tools to connect software systems and automate tasks. This included creating a digital signage system for clients and a tool to help support engineers retrieve customer information from our CRM efficiently. Alongside this, I‚Äôve maintained networks, servers, and workstations, providing customer support where needed.

While studying at TU Delft, I also worked as a student assistant, guiding students through Python programming and microcontroller projects, helping them with assignments and practical applications of their learning. Next to that I also gave lectures to students about programming in Python.

## üö© What is my goal?

I‚Äôm eager to continue growing as a software engineer and ultimately transition into a **technical project manager** role. I want to develop my leadership skills, manage cross-functional teams, and contribute to the strategic planning and successful delivery of software projects. While I‚Äôve completed advanced courses in Python programming, I‚Äôm also keen to expand my knowledge in other programming languages, dive deeper into computer science, and explore software architecture.
